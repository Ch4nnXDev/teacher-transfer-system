2. Branching Strategy
Each feature is developed in a separate branch following this naming convention:

feature/<feature-name>
For example:

3. Making Commits
Write meaningful commit messages following this format:
[Feature] Short description of changes
Example:

git commit -m "[Feature] Added login functionality"
Keep commits small and focused.
4. Pull Requests
Once your feature is complete, create a Pull Request (PR) to merge it into the developer-template branch.
Ensure your PR includes:

A clear title
A short description of changes
Mentioning any related issues
5. Code Review & Merging
Your PR will be reviewed by another team member.
If changes are requested, update your code and push to the same feature branch.
